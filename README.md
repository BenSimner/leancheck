llcheck
=======

**This is a work in progress.  Come back after a while.**

llcheck is a simple enumerative property-based testing library.  It works by
producing *listings* of test values, which are essentially (possibly infinite)
lists of finite lists of same-sized values.  It is somewhat similar to [Feat] in
that regard.
